# Uber-CPP-ConsoleApp
 a comprehensive C++ console application  that employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to simulates the functionality of an Uber-like service. Dive into the intricacies of ride-sharing logic, user management, and payment processing through an organized collection of source files.

In the Uber C++ project, the `date.cpp` and `date.h` files are dedicated to date-related functionalities. This module takes care of tasks such as parsing dates and managing date formats. The `driver.cpp` and `driver.h` files serve as the implementation and header for the driver module, encompassing driver status, and other driver-specific operations. The `passenger.cpp` and `passenger.h` files handle logic for the passenger module, incorporating tasks like passenger registration, status, and other passenger-specific operations. Meanwhile, the `payment.cpp` and `payment.h` files house essential components for seamless payment processing and related functionalities. The `Source.cpp` file acts as the main entry point, orchestrating the integration of various modules and serving as the starting point for program execution. The `trip.cpp` and `trip.h` files manage the intricacies of trip planning and execution, dealing with tasks such as trip creation and tracking trip status. The `uber.cpp` file serves as the core, encapsulating the essence of the Uber simulation with fundamental logic. It acts as the central hub where different modules are coordinated to provide the overall functionality of the application. Lastly, the `user.cpp` and `user.h` files handle user-related functionalities, facilitating common operations for both drivers and passengers, including login, authentication, and profile management.
